In future joining the /f2ptwink channel on Aerie Peak - US will not be possible without first accepting the following rules (and those not running the addon may be removed from the channel):

[LIST=1]
[*]/f2ptwink is to be a channel for f2ps, run by f2ps. Owning a p2p in this channel will not confer any special priviledges to that p2p. Any p2ps who are channel members will be expected to play 20-24 bracket BGs under the same level and stat carrying gear restrictions as a purely f2p character (that is an f2p with no assistance from other accounts, outside of that possible through entering the LFG or BG queues).
[*]As a member of the channel you will be expected to play honorably and fairly, as you will be representing not only yourself but the channel and community as a whole. If anyone points out AP-US players for bad or unsporting behaviour, it should be those we can say are not a part of this community.
[LIST]
[*] Play for objectives, and not achievements, honor or stats.
[*] No emote spamming.
[*] If you can cap, do so.  No flag holding.
[*] No graveyard farming.  This is defined as killing players as they spawn.  If the enemy team is to be contained within their own GY, then it is to be done from the road on one side, and a similar distance on the others, so that there can be no confusion between containment and farming.
[/LIST]
[*]Premading as or with a 24 is to be restricted to one 24 and one f2p per BG, and is not to be done on a long term basis.  This is to allow a 24 to join in with a friend who plays an f2p, while the 24 transitions to playing on an f2p of their own, or a 20 with restricted gear. Running big premades with 24s makes the whole community look bad.

[*]Similarly, persistent trolling, otherwise creating drama in the channel, or persistently showing disrespect towards other players or channel members, will be subject to warnings and bans.
[*]There is to be no running of addons that interfere with the normal functioning of those of other players, who are using the current, official version of F2PAddon available from curse.com
